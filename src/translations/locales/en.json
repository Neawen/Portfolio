        "description": "In this project, I developed an interactive web interface for an interior architect, integrating a presentation of her work, a login page for content management, and a media upload modal. This work allowed me to apply my JavaScript skills to manipulate the DOM and manage user interactions. By communicating with an API, I ensured data persistence. The designs were provided via Figma, and the project was managed in Visual Studio Code and versioned with GitHub, following a Kanban board for task organization. This project gave me comprehensive experience in dynamic front-end development with a from-scratch approach."

        "description": "As part of the complete redesign of the Kasa site, I developed the front-end in React, following responsive Figma designs. The project included creating interactive components, such as a photo gallery with circular navigation and a collapse system for managing additional information. The project was carried out without an active back-end, using a JSON file to simulate housing listings. Styles were applied via SASS to ensure a responsive and uniform design."

The application allows users to access a secure and responsive banking dashboard, with login and logout features, using an existing API document for authentication. In preparation for future transaction management features, I documented the necessary API routes following Swagger guidelines. I also integrated Green Code practices to optimize images and components, improving the application's performance and sustainability."

It highlights my projects built with technologies like React, JavaScript, and SASS, as well as smooth animations for an engaging user experience. The project integrates the GitHub API to display my latest updated project in real time. In terms of performance, the site is optimized for fast loading and smooth navigation. On the SEO and accessibility side, each page is carefully structured to ensure good ranking and an inclusive experience."
